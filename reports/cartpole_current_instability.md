Source commit: `12e748b6eecd1e4db64b210e03ced4cb537ca895`

Run evidence: `runs/cartpole_current_10k_12e748b_r2/`

## Decision

The current warmup/reinforce configuration does not reliably learn CartPole.
The planned 10,000-update screen was stopped by user decision after every seed
had produced repeated deterministic evaluations near the minimum episode
length. This is an intentionally truncated screen, not a completed 10,000-step
benchmark.

The first clearly broken boundary is policy improvement: the learned latent
contains useful control information, but the critic does not provide reliable
action preferences and the trained actor either becomes constant or remains
random-like.

## Three-seed result

All runs used the same code and configuration. Only the deterministic seed
differed.

| Seed | Last update observed | Deterministic evaluation rewards | Outcome |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 5,300 | 9.30, 9.30, 9.25, 9.30, 9.30 | actor entropy collapsed |
| 1 | 5,500 | 18.25, 13.40, 18.65, 9.30, 9.30 | transient random-like behavior, then constant actor |
| 2 | 8,500 | 9.30, 11.40, 9.25, 9.25, 9.35, 9.30, 9.40, 9.40 | actor remained high-entropy/random-like |

The runs were operationally healthy. Collector logs show every published
weight version delivered and loaded. Per-run USS stabilized near 3.2 GiB,
available host RAM remained roughly 15-17 GiB, and no child process failed.
This rules out the repaired collector broadcast path and resource exhaustion as
causes of this learning result.

## Within-seed collapse probe

Seed 1 provides a controlled comparison between its best checkpoint at step
3,000 and its collapsed periodic checkpoint at step 5,000. Both probes used the
same 512 simulator states and probe seed.

| Measurement | Step 3,000 | Step 5,000 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Deterministic evaluation reward | 18.65 | 9.30 |
| Actor entropy | 0.693 | 0.451 |
| Mean actor probability of action 1 | 0.499 | 0.822 |
| Actor preference histogram | action 0: 435; action 1: 77 | action 0: 0; action 1: 512 |
| Actor vs real-rollout action accuracy | 0.490 | 0.510 |
| Model/critic Q vs real-rollout accuracy | 0.442 | 0.442 |
| Model/critic Q vs real-return correlation | -0.353 | -0.009 |
| Mean one-step state MSE | 0.109 | 0.355 |
| One-step action-effect sign accuracy | 1.0 | 1.0 |

The step-3,000 score was not evidence of a competent policy. Its action
probabilities were almost exactly uniform, so its modest return was
random-like. By step 5,000 the actor preferred action 1 on every probed state,
while its agreement with real action values remained at chance.

One-step state prediction became less accurate on the independent probe, but
the model retained the correct direction of both action effects. The critic's
multi-step action ranking remained uninformative at both checkpoints.

## Frozen-latent supervision probe

A fresh actor was trained against the same deterministic heuristic labels on
4,096 posterior latent states from each checkpoint. Actor initialization,
dataset seed, training budget, and evaluation episodes were fixed.

| Frozen world model | Train accuracy | Mean deterministic return |
|---|---:|---:|
| Step 3,000 | 0.611 | 22.85 |
| Step 5,000 | 0.666 | 54.65 |

The later latent was more useful to a clean supervised control target even
while the repository's trained actor had collapsed. Representation quality is
still imperfect and world-model rollout fidelity remains a secondary concern,
but observation encoding is not the first failed boundary.

## Mechanism hypothesis

`actor_warmup_steps` currently suppresses both actor and critic updates:

```python
in_actor_warmup = self.train_step < self.config.actor_warmup_steps
skip_ac_batch = in_actor_warmup or self.should_skip_ac_update()
```

At step 3,000, actor and critic training therefore start together. Across all
three seeds, the first logged imagined critic distribution had mean `23.505`
and standard deviation `0.00000165`; actor entropy was approximately
`log(2) = 0.693`. Imagined reward variance was also nearly zero.

The reinforce loss centers and scales advantages by their batch standard
deviation. When the critic and imagined returns contain almost no trustworthy
action-dependent variation, this can promote tiny model/value differences to
unit-scale policy gradients. The entropy coefficient is only `0.001`. Seeds 0
and 1 then developed arbitrary action commitments; seed 2 retained high entropy
without learning control.

This is the leading causal hypothesis, not yet a demonstrated cause. The
intervention below is designed to falsify it.

## One evidence-selected next experiment

Decouple critic warmup from actor warmup:

1. Keep the collector random and the actor frozen through update 3,000.
2. Train the world model and critic during that period instead of suppressing
   both actor and critic.
3. Start actor optimization at update 3,000 with the existing actor loss and
   all other settings unchanged.

Use a staged stop rule:

1. First run one seed slightly beyond the 3,000-step boundary. Verify that
   critic loss is active during warmup, actor parameters remain frozen, and a
   step-3,000 Q probe is no longer uniform/constant and improves agreement with
   real simulator action values. Stop if it does not.
2. Only if that gate passes, run seeds 0, 1, and 2 concurrently to 5,000 updates.
   Reject the change if deterministic behavior remains near 9-10 or actors
   become constant. Extend toward the existing 10,000-step contract only for a
   clear cross-seed behavioral improvement.

Do not add entropy changes, a new actor objective, or world-model auxiliaries
to this experiment. Those would prevent attribution. Do not return to Pong
until a state-dependent CartPole policy is stable across seeds.

## Reliability follow-up

Interrupted manifests correctly record `status: interrupted` and evaluation
history, but incorrectly retain `progress.train_step: 0` and `env_steps: 0`.
Fix this bookkeeping issue separately from the learning experiment so it does
not alter the scientific intervention.
